## Welcome to my portfolio page

This project was created with React and React-Redux

You can find the deployed version here: www.deutges.com


There are multiple branches for testing/development purposes
master branch on git, live version: www.deutges.com
push to the live heroku website (only when locally on master branch)
git push heroku master

different branch on git, depending on the current feature, staging origin to heroku: https://pacific-waters-60077.herokuapp.com/
push to that one: git push staging *nameofbranch*:master
on this heroku repo you can also use the --force flag at the end, as sometimes you might have very different code as from the feature before
