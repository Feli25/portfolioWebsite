                  <h3>Elviras NÃ¤hspass</h3>
                  This Website was created as an online presence for a sewing school. In collaboration with a UX/UI Designer.
                  It gives everyone the possibility to see all the information about the sewing school and get in contact with the teachers.
                  I also programmed a CMS in the background, you can log in as an administrator and edit all the information on the website.

                  <h3>HS - Be strong</h3>
                  A website programmed in the course of a few hours, during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
                  This was built for a hospital to be able to answer to questions related to Covid-19 without the people needing to come in house or block the phone lines.
                  You can register as a user and ask a question, certified doctors in quarantine at home can answer them.
